# Clothing Segmentation and Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on building a deep learning model for accurate clothing segmentation and classification. The pipeline consists of a segmentation model to isolate clothing items from images and a classification model to categorize these items into predefined classes.

## Features
- **Clothing Segmentation**: High-precision segmentation to isolate individual clothing items from images.
- **Classification**: Categorization of segmented clothing items into specific classes.
- **Preprocessing**: Effective data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
- **Evaluation**: Thorough assessment using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - PyTorch
  - NumPy, Pandas
- **Deep Learning Techniques**:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - U-Net for segmentation

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Resized and augmented images to ensure consistency and improve model generalization.  
2. **Segmentation**: Trained a U-Net model to accurately extract clothing item regions from images.  
3. **Classification**: Implemented a CNN-based classifier to assign categories to segmented clothing items.  
4. **Evaluation**: Used metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU) for segmentation and accuracy for classification.

## Results
- Achieved precise segmentation of clothing items from complex backgrounds.
- High classification accuracy across various clothing categories.

## Future Work
- Enhance the model to handle occlusions and overlapping clothing items.
- Expand dataset to include more diverse clothing categories and styles.
